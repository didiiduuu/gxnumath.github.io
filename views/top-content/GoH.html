                    Howell Tong (汤家豪), born in 1944 in Hong Kong, is a statistician who has made fundamental contributions to nonlinear time series analysis, semi-parametric statistics, non-parametric statistics, dimension reduction, model selection, likelihood-free statistics and other areas. In the words of Professor Peter Whittle (FRS): "The striking feature of Howell Tong's … is the continuing freshness, boldness and spirit of enquiry which inform them-indeed, proper qualities for an explorer. He stands as the recognized innovator and authority in his subject, while remaining disarmingly direct and enthusiastic." His work, in the words of Sir David Cox, "links two fascinating fields, nonlinear time series and deterministic dynamical systems." He is the father of the threshold time series models, which have extensive applications in ecology, economics, epidemiology, finance and others. Altogether, he has read 5 papers (-4 published in JRSS B and 1 in JRSS A) to the Royal Statistical Society, UK. The most recent one (-jointly with Yingcun Xia, Wai Keung Li and Lixing Zhu) was on dimension reduction in semi-parametric statistics by pioneering the approach based on the minimum average variance estimation. He has also made numerous novel contributions to nonparametric statistics (obtaining the surprising result that cross-validation was consistent for dimension estimation and does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality), Markov chain modelling (with applications to weather data), reliability, non-stationary time series analysis (in both the frequency domain and the time domain), chaos and wavelets.

                    In 1982, he was the founding chair professor of Statistics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In 1986, he was appointed as chair professor of statistics (and sometime director of the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics) at the University of Kent at Canterbury, UK, a post he held until 1999. He was the first ethnic Chinese to hold such a chair professorship in the UK, thus opening the door for other ethnic Chinese statisticians. From 1999 to September 2009, Tong was chair professor of statistics at the London School of Economics and founded the Centre for the Analysis of Time Series. Between 1997 and 2004, Tong was concurrently chair professor of statistics, founding dean of the graduate school and later pro-vice chancellor, at the University of Hong Kong.

                    Since October 1, 2009, he has been an emeritus professor at the London School of Economics and was twice (2009, 2010) holder of the Saw Swee Hock Professorship of Statistics at the National University of Singapore. He was a guest professor, Academy of Mathematics and System Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences from 2000 to 2004, a distinguished visiting professor of statistics at the University of Hong Kong from 2005 to 2013, a distinguished professor-at-large, University of Electronic Science & Technology of China from 2016-2021 and has been a distinguished visiting professor, Tsinghua University, China, since 2019.

                    Tong was an elected member of the International Statistical Institute in 1983. In 1986, he was the session organizer and an invited speaker of the session on time series analysis, at the First World Congress of the Bernoulli Society, held at Tashkent in the former Soviet Union. In 1994, he was the Special Plenary Lecturer at the 15th Nordic Meeting in Mathematical Statistics, held at Lund, Sweden. In 1999, he delivered the Alan T. Craig lecture at the University of Iowa, USA. He was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1993, an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, England in 1999, and a Foreign Member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in 2000. In 2000, he became the first statistician to win the (class II) State Prize in Natural Sciences in China. In 2002, the University of Hong Kong gave him their then-highest award, the Distinguished Research Achievement Award, carrying with it a research grant of HK$1,000,000 per annum for three years. The Royal Statistical Society, UK, awarded him their Guy Medal in Silver in 2007 in recognition of his "...many important contributions to time series analysis over a distinguished career and in particular for his fundamental and highly influential paper "Threshold autoregression, limit cycles and cyclical data", read to the society in 1980, which paved the way for a major body of work in non-linear time series modelling." In 2011, he delivered the Paolu Hsu lecture at the Peking University, China. In 2012, the International Chinese Statistical Association awarded him the Distinguished Achievement Award. In 2014, he held a senior fellowship at the Institute of Advanced Studies, University of Bologna, Italy.

                    He has been strenuously promoting statistical education and research in China for many decades. In October 1981, he was invited by Professor Hua Lo-Geng (a close friend before the latter's demise) to visit the then Institute of Applied Mathematics (IAM) in Beijing. He spent a month lecturing there to statisticians from all over Mainland China. In the following month, he gave lectures at Jiao Tong University in Xian, the then Textile University of China in Shanghai and the Sun Yet San (Zhong Shan) University in Guangzhou. In 1984, he was the overseas adviser to the Organizing Committee of the First National Conference of Time Series Analysis held in Beijing. Since those early days, he has been a frequent visitor to China, holding several distinguished visiting professorships in succession mentioned above. All in all, he has inspired and nurtured several generations of Chinese statisticians in the Mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, many of whom have become leaders in statistics and beyond.
